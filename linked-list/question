<!-- 
Stack Implementation Details:
Can you explain the difference between an array-based implementation and a linked list-based implementation of a stack?
How would you handle stack overflow and underflow conditions in your implementation?
Can you discuss the time complexity of various stack operations in your implementation?

Queue Implementation Details:
Explain the difference between a regular queue and a priority queue. How would you implement a priority queue?
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays versus linked lists for implementing queues.
How would you handle queue overflow and underflow conditions in your implementation?

Applications and Use Cases:
Describe a real-world scenario where you would use a stack. How would you implement it, and what benefits does using a stack provide in that scenario?
Similarly, describe a real-world scenario where you would use a queue. How would you implement it, and what benefits does using a queue provide in that scenario?

Algorithmic Questions:
Implement a function to reverse a stack using only stack operations (push, pop, peek).
Write an algorithm to check if a given string of parentheses is balanced or not using a stack.
Implement a queue using two stacks.

Performance and Optimization:
How would you optimize a stack or queue implementation for memory usage or performance?
Discuss the trade-offs between using an array-based implementation versus a linked list-based implementation in terms of performance and memory usage.

Concurrency and Thread Safety:
How would you ensure thread safety in a multi-threaded environment when using a stack or queue?
Discuss potential concurrency issues that might arise when multiple threads access the same stack or queue concurrently.

Integration and Interoperability:
How would you integrate a stack or queue data structure into an existing codebase? What considerations would you take into account?
Discuss strategies for interoperability between different programming languages or systems that use stacks or queues. -->
